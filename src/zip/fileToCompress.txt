You should implement several functions in dedicated files

read.js - implement function that reads file fileToRead.txt content using Readable Stream and prints it's content into process.stdout
write.js - implement function that writes process.stdin data into file fileToWrite.txt content using Writable Stream
transform.js - implement function that reads data from process.stdin, reverses text using Transform Stream and then writes it into process.stdout
